# github-show
It's a project to test the Github API. In this project, I used the Github API to show all repositories from of a user and listed it by stars.

## How to config
In the beginning of <b>application.js</b> <code>(/assets/javascripts/)</code> you should to set new value with your own Personal Access Tokens. To create a new token <a href="https://github.com/settings/tokens/new">click here</a>.

After that, to set a new Github's username just look up on 171 line in <b>application.js</b> as well. The <b>google</b> user is the default.
